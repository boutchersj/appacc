//These are the CSS rules that allow you to hide something from the visual display but make it available for screen readers//

//"Note
The following CSS approaches will NOT do the same thing:


display: none; or visibility: hidden; hides content for everyone, including screen reader users

Zero values for pixel sizes, such as width: 0px; height: 0px; removes that element from the flow of your document, 
meaning screen readers will ignore it" --Credit: freeCodeCamp//
